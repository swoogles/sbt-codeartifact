Publishing sbt plugins differs from publishing normal JVM projects in several key ways:
1. Plugin Metadata: sbt plugins require additional metadata in the build definition to specify that they are
   plugins. This includes setting the `sbtPlugin` key to `true` in the `build.sbt` file.
   sbtPlugin := true
2. Scala Version Compatibility: sbt plugins must be cross-built for specific versions of sbt and Scala. The sbt
   version compatibility is specified using the `sbtVersion` setting, and you often need to ensure compatibility
   with multiple Scala versions.
3. Publishing Repository: sbt plugins are typically published to a different repository than standard JVM
   artifacts. The most common repository for sbt plugins is the `sbt-plugin-releases` or `sbt-plugin-snapshots`
   repositories on Maven Central or other similar repositories.
4. Plugin Identifier: sbt plugins require a unique identifier defined through the `organization` and `name`
   settings. This helps in uniquely identifying the plugin in the sbt ecosystem.
5. **I think this is the key point** Plugin Versioning: It's important to follow versioning conventions that align with sbt's expectations, often
   ensuring compatibility with specific sbt versions. This might involve using version suffixes to denote
   compatibility (e.g., `1.0.0-sbt-1.0`).
6. Usage in Projects: Once published, sbt plugins are used differently than regular dependencies. They are added
   to the `project/plugins.sbt` file of an sbt project, rather than the `libraryDependencies` in the `build.sbt`.
7. Testing and Compatibility: Testing sbt plugins often requires setting up multiple sbt versions to ensure
   compatibility, which might not be a consideration for standard JVM projects.
In summary, while both sbt plugins and normal JVM projects involve compiling and packaging Scala or Java code, sbt
plugins require additional considerations for metadata, compatibility, and publishing locations specific to the
sbt ecosystem.
Maybe.
